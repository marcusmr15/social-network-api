# Social Network API without SQL

## Description

This Social Network API is designed to handle large amounts of unstructured data, providing a robust backend for a social networking application. The API uses a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and is built with Node.js, Express.js, and Mongoose. It supports CRUM operations, which means it is able to create, read, update, and delete:
- Users ü§ñ
- Thoughts üí≠
- Reactions ‚ùï

## Installation

Given that this project is not deployed, you must clone this repository in order to test it in your computer.

1. Clone the repo using your command line by first navigating to the folder in which you would like the project to be stored. Then run:
 ~~~
git@github.com:marcusmr15/social-network-api.git
~~~

2. Install the required dependencies:
~~~
npm i
~~~

3. Start the server by running:
~~~
node server.js
~~~


## Usage

Once installed, you will need a tool like `Postman` or `Insomnia` to be able to interact with the API, in order to make HTTP requests to the endpoints. You can download either of them for free on the internet. 

‚ùóImportant: the `{base}` URL for all endpoints is:
~~~
http://localhost:3001/api
~~~
